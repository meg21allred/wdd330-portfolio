    <h1>Notes for Week 7</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 11 Further Functions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Function Properties and Methods</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The call() method can be used to set the value of "this" inside a function to an object that is provided as the first arugment. ex. sayHello.call(clark)</li>
            <li>If a function doesn't refer to an object as "this" in its body, it can still be called using the call() method, but you need to provide "null" as its first arugment.</li>
            <li><b>Custom properties</b> - adding your own properties to functions.</li>
            <li><b>Memoization</b>- a feature that provides result caching. You might want to do this if the result you are computing takes a lot of time. <br>
                ex. square.cache; << {"3": 9, "-11" : 121 }</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Definition -</b> an anonymous function that is invoked as soon as it's defined.</li>
            <li>iffes are a usef way of performing a task while keeping any variables wrapped up within the scope of the function.<br></li>
            <li>Good uses for IFFEs</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Temporary Variables</li>
                <li>Initialization Code</li>
                <li>Safe Use of Strict Mode</li>
                <li>Creating Self-contained Code Blocks</li>

            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Self-defining Functions</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Definition - </b>a functions that is able to call itself and also define itself and even redefine itself.</li>
            <li><b>Init-Time Branching -</b>A technique that can be used with the feature detection to create functions that rewrite themselves.</li>

        </ul>
        <li><b>Recursive Functions</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Defintion -</b>a function that invokes itself until a certain condtion is met.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Callbacks</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Definition -</b>functions passed to other functions as arguments and then invoked inside the 
            <br>function they are passed to.</li>
            <li>Used to facilitate -<b>Event-driven Asynchronous Programming</b>which means only one piece of code with be processed at a time.</li>
            <ul><li>used to ensure waiting for tasks to complete doesn't hold up the execution of other parts of the program.</li></ul>

        </ul>
        <li><b>Promises</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Definition - </b>represents the future result of an Asynchronous operation.</li>
            <li>The Promise life-cycle</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Resovled - the Asynchronous operation was completed successfully.</li>
                <li>Rejected - the Asynchronous operation didn't work, didn't complete or resulted in an error.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>A Super Promise</b> - a pending phase while you wait on the result of an operation, then deal with the results in a proper way.</li>
            <li>ex - const promise = new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
                // initialization code goes here
                if (success) {
                    resolve(value);
                } else {
                    reject(error);
                }
            });const promise = new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
                // initialization code goes here
                if (success) {
                    resolve(value);
                } else {
                    reject(error);
                }
            });</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Async Functions</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Definition - </b>Functions preceded by the "async" keyword that allow you to write Asynchronous code as if it was synchronus.</li>

        </ul>
        <li><b>Closures</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Definition - </b>a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope of another function, but is then kept alive and used in another part of the program</li>
            <li><b>Generators - </b>special functions used to produce iteratiors that maintain the state of a value.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Introductions to Functional Programming</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to pass functions as arguments, return them from other functions, and use anonymous functions and closures, are all fundamental elements of functional programming.</li>
            <li><b>Pure Function features</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Return value should only depend on the values provided as arguments.</li>
                <li>There are no side effects.</li>
                <li>Referential transparency.</li>
                <li>Must have at least one argument.</li>
                <li>Must have a return value.</li>

            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Currying</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Definition -</b> a process that involves the partial application of functions.</li>
        </ul>
