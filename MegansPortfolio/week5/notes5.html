   <h1>Chapter 10 Testing and Debugging</h1>
   <ul>
       <li><b>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</b></li>
       <ul>
           <li>Causes of problems</li>
           <ul>
               <li>System error - there's a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
               <li>Programmer error - the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; or a typo.</li>
               <li>User error - the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
           </ul>
           <li>Exceptions - an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</li>
           <li>Stack Trace - a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.</li>
           <li>Warnings - can occur if there's an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash.</li>
       </ul>
       <li><b>The Importance of Testing and Debugging</b></li>
       <ul>
           <li>A good programer should ensure that the code they write fails loudly in developement so any errors car be Identified and fixed quickly.</li>
       </ul>
       <li><b>Strict Mode</b></li>
       <ul>
           <li>Mode that produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.</li>
           <li>Writing code in strict mode can help improve its clarity and speed.</li>
           <li>To use strict mode the following string must be added to the firstline of a JavaScript file: 'use strict';</li>
           <li>Strict mode can be used on a "per function" basis. use the same string as the frist line in the body of the function.</li>
           <li>The reccommended way to use strict mode is to place all your code into a self-invoking function.</li>
           <ul>
               <li>This is reccommended because you can't garuntee everyone working on your project is using strict mode which with cause 
                   <br>problems if you ditact all your JavaScript to be in strict mode.
               </li>
           </ul>
           <li>Linting tools - ex. "JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint - can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code beyond strict mode.</li>
           <li>Feature Detection - The process of using an "if" statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to call the method.</li>
           <li>Debugging in the Browser - run the program with breakpoints to find bugs.</li>
           <ul>
               <li>Options for debugging JavaScript code in the broswer:</li>
               <ul>
                   <li>The Trusty Alert - alert() stops a program from running until OK is clicked and allows the ability to effectively insert breakpoints to check the value of variables.</li>
                   <li>Using the Console - can be used to log the value of variables at different stages of the program.</li>
                   <li>Debugging Tools - a tool that allows you to set breakpoints in your code that will pause a program at certain points.</li>
               </ul>
           </ul>
       </ul>
       <li><b>Error Objects</b></li>
       <ul>
           <li>can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function.
               <br>ex. - <code>const error = new Error('Opps, something when wrong');</code>
           </li>
           <li>Objects for Specific errors:</li>
           <ul>
               <li>EvalError - (only for backwards compatibility) - identify errors when using the global eval() function.</li>
               <li>RangeError - thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</li>
               <li>ReferenceError - thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn't exist.</li>
               <li>SyntaxError - thrown when there's an error in the code's syntax.</li>
               <li>URIError - thrown when there's a problem encoding or decoding the URI</li>
               <li>InternalError - thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine.</li>
               <li>TypeError - used to create custom error objects.</li>
           </ul>
       </ul>
       <li><b>Throwing Exceptions</b></li>
       <ul>
           <li>It is possible to throw your own exceptions using the "throw" statement.</li>
           <li>It is best practice to throw an error object ex. - <code>throw new Error('Something has gone wrong');</code></li>

       </ul>
       <li><b>Exception Handling</b></li>
       <ul>
           <li>Occurs when the program terminates with an error message.</li>
           <li>Try, Catch, and Finally</li>
           <ul>
               <li>Try block - will run the code inside the block as normal, but if an exception occurs it will pass the error object that is thrown onto the a 'catch' block</li>
               <li>Catch block - will only run in an exception is thrown inside the 'try' block.</li>
               <li>Finally block - cann be added after a catch block and will always be executed after the try or catch block, regardless of whether an exception occurred.</li>
           </ul>
       </ul>
       <li><b>Testing Framworks</b></li>
       <ul>
           <li>Provide a structure to write meaningful tests and then run them.</li>
           <li>Framework Example:</li>
           <ul>
               <li>Jest - Created by Facebook, it makes it easy to create adn run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions.</li>

           </ul>
       </ul>
   </ul>
